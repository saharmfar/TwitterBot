TwitterBot
==========

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>A bot is an automated software program that can execute certain commands when it receives a specific input. A socialbot is a bot that spreads through social networking sites through a human behavioral archetype that resembles that of a real user.</p>
<p>The competition for this project involved each group of students fielding a Twitter socialbot that would do something interesting and relevant to social and computational intelligence - the team with the highest amount of followers or mentions was the winner. This competition made students better Pythonistas and gave us more familiarity with third party APIs.</p>  
<p>Specific Twitter user accounts called “target users” were provided by our Professor, with the challenge being to effectively interact with them. Each team deployed one socialbot that could directly interact with the target users. Our bot happened to focus on movies and tweet about things relevant to our target users.</p>
<p>An error encountered during the following process led to an extreme acceleration in the pace of our following, resulting in the suspension of our bot account and the loss of approximately 24 hours of experiment time. Our bot generated a total of 91 status updates over the course of approximately six total days of uptime. The status updates included 24 retweets of updates posted by users in the experiment group and 27 mentions of users in the experiment group through “canned” tweets, resulting in four user replies and one user mention.</P>
